Fluff: Centuries ago, there was a race of Elves who were very skilled at magically altering living beings. Towards the end, there was a fad about pet foxes, and liked to breed and show them - but were not above magically enhancing the vulpines, bringing them up to nearly as intelligent as baseline humans, and giving them grasping paws and longer lifespans - although not as long as the Elves.
However, disaster struck as a plague - a magically enhanced cold that only impacted the Elves - burned through the community. Within only a few days, 99% of the elves had died, and the remainder were not enough to sustain their people. The remainders fully uplifted the Vulmer, who took on the Elvish society.
