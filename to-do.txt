Finish up Order changes, expansion+creation like Race

center player list

center races list


Move 'has avatar spawned a race' bool to World. Once per *world*, or Once per *player*?
Create-Order needs to be redone and moved to single_location.
Maybe split up single_location actions up, into location/action and do_action?

Unit Creation and editing.

Cities have 'non-movable armies'?

Change Command Race to seperate command_race page, pass along point-costs somehow. Allows for Command Race/Command-Avatar-CR/Command Order-CR.
Command order - point cost extra for nonowners, or just remove that entirely

Allow ownership-change of orders [Owner only]

Kill off races with 0 locations or cities. [Currently, they become hidden]

Add: Import Old World for new world. All old races/orders become Orphaned, avatars become Tombstone Provencial items, armies destroyed, etc.
